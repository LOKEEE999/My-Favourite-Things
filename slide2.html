    <h1>Game I play the most</h1>
    <p>I have three games in total that I play with my friends all the time <br>
    and also my Family as their the group of people I spend time with the most. <br>
Thoses three things are:</p>
<h2>No.1: Cricket</h2>

<p>Cricket is obviously is the 1st favourite thing for a Kid like me as far as I know <br>
and i watched the whole game everytime until Sachin left.</p>
<h2>No.2: Table Tennis</h2>

<p>Table Tennis is second favourite game of mine because as this is one of the games you can play <br>
without even moving.</p>
<h2>No.3: Badminton</h2>
